\subsection{Summary}
\label{sum:recurrent-event}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
A recurrent event series is modelled as an intersection of a collection and a situation. Indeed, a recurrent event is seen as a collection, since it contains entities that share one or more common properties and are unified conceptually (unifying factors). These entities are member of the collection, and are all consecutive events. At the same time, a recurrent event is a situation, intended as a relational context in which the contextualised things are based on a frame: a recurrent event is similar to a plan that defines how the things involved in that plan (i.e. the specific events) shall be carried out, e.g. where the events shall be located, in which time of the year, etc.
