\subsection{Summary}
\label{sum:Spatial}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The Spatial Extent pattern is characterized by a set of \textsf{Interiors}, which are in turn characterized by a \textsf{PointInSpace-Sequence}. A \textsf{PointInSpace-Sequence} consists of \textsf{PointInSpace-SequenceElements}, which are constituted by \textsf{PointInSpace}. A \textsf{PointInSpace} is described by a value and a reference system. \textsf{PIS-Sequence} is a specialization of the \textsf{Sequence} Pattern (Section \ref{sec:Sequence}). We also further choose to use the Explicit Typing Pattern for \textsf{PointInSpace} and \textsf{ReferenceSystem}.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align}
\textsf{Interior} &\sqsubseteq \forall \textsf{isDefinedBy.PIS-Sequence} \\
\textsf{PIS-Sequence} &\sqsubseteq \forall \textsf{hasFirst.PIS-SequenceElement} \\
\textsf{PIS-Sequence} &\sqsubseteq \forall \textsf{hasLast.PIS-SequenceElement} \\
\textsf{PIS-SequenceElement} &\sqsubseteq \forall \textsf{hasNext.PIS-SequenceElement} \\
\textsf{PIS-SequenceElement} &\sqsubseteq \mathord{=}1 \textsf{constitutedBy.PointInSpace} \\
\textsf{PointInSpace} &\sqsubseteq \forall \textsf{hasReferenceSystem.ReferenceSystem} \\
\textsf{PointInSpace} &\sqsubseteq \forall \textsf{hasValue.Value}
\end{align}

\subsection{Remarks}
\label{rem:Spatial}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
We would also like the pattern to be able to express that a \textsf{SpatialExtent} consists of exactly some \textsf{Interiors} and no others. This is done by equipping the pattern with an axiom that must be tailored to the use-case and two rules.

\begin{equation}
\textsf{TemporalExtent} \sqsubseteq \mathord{=}n\textsf{contains.}\top
\end{equation}
where $n$ is the number of expected \textsf{Interiors}. The two rules are as follows.
