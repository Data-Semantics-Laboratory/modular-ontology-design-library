\textsf{TimeInterval} &\sqsubset \textsf{ComplexTemporalExtent} \\
\textsf{TimeInterval} &\sqsubset \mathord{=}1 \textsf{startsFrom.PointInTime} \\
\textsf{TimeInterval} &\sqsubset \mathord{=}1 \textsf{endsAt.PointInTime} \\

\subsection{Explanations}
\label{exp:Temporal}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Numerical Restriction: a \textsf{TemporalExtent} \textsf{contains} exactly $n$ \textsf{ComplexTemporalExtents}. See below remarks.
\item Subclass: every \textsf{TimeInterval} is a \textsf{ComplexTemporalExtent}.
\item Numerical Restriction: a \textsf{TimeInterval} \textsf{startsAt} exactly 1 \textsf{PointInTime}.
\item Numerical Restriction: a \textsf{TimeInterval} \textsf{endsAt} exactly 1 \textsf{PointInTime}.
\item Subclass: every \textsf{PointInTime} is a \textsf{ComplexTemporalExtent}.
\item Numerical Restriction: a \textsf{PointInTime} has exactly 1 \textsf{ReferenceSystem}.
\item Numerical Restriction: a \textsf{PointInTime} has exactly 1 \textsf{Value}.
\end{enumerate}
