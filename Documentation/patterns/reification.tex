\subsection{Summary}
\label{sum:Property}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The \textsf{AgentRole} pattern is essentially a reification of association with something. That is, it's very unlikely that an Agent will be associated with something for all time. Thus, the association relation is not binary, perhaps $\textit{associated}(x,y,t)$, agent $x$ is associated with thing $y$ at time $t$. Thus, the reification. The association becomes a concept in its own right and has a temporal extent, allowing an \textsf{Agent} to be associated to a \textsf{Thing} (e.g. \textsf{Event}, Section \ref{sec:Event}) for some \textsf{TemporalExtent}.
