\subsection{Summary}
\label{sum:Aggregation,}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
The pattern for an Aggregation, Bag, or Collection is relatively simple. The Bag is a type of unordered collection. This pattern was included in this library for demonstrating a more approachable interface for the partonymy pattern, with respect to membership. For example, we may use this pattern to represent a committee. In this case, the committee member is the\textsf{BagItem}, the committee is the \textsf{Bag}, and the \textsf{itemOf} property is a sub-property to the \textsf{po-member} property found in the Partonymy/Meronymy pattern (Section \ref{sec:Partonymy}). This pattern was adapted from the Bag ontology design pattern and be found at \url{http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Bag}. Some language is borrowed from the description.

\subsection{Axiomatization}
\label{axs:Aggregation,}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{align}
% General Axioms
\textsf{Bag} &\sqsubseteq \textsf{Collection} \\
\textsf{itemOf} &\sqsubseteq \textsf{po-member} \\
% Domain and Range Restrictions
\exists\textsf{itemOf.BagItem} &\sqsubseteq \textsf{Bag} \\
\textsf{Bag} &\sqsubseteq \forall\textsf{itemOf.BagItem} \\
\exists\textsf{hasSize} &\sqsubseteq \textsf{Bag} \\
\top &\sqsubseteq \textsf{hasSize.xsd:positiveInteger}
% Inverse Aliases (if any) 
\end{align}

\subsection{Explanations}
\label{exp:Aggregation,}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{enumerate}
\item Subclass: a \textsf{Bag} is a \textsf{Collection}
\item Subproperty: \textsf{itemOf} is a subproperty to \textsf{po-member} from the Partonymy Pattern (Section \ref{sec:Partonymy}).
\item Scoped Domain: the scoped domain of \textsf{itemOf}, scoped by \textsf{BagItem}, is \textsf{Bag}.
\item Scoped Range: the scoped range of \textsf{itemOf}, scoped by \textsf{Bag}, is \textsf{BagItem}.
\item Scoped Domain: the scoped domain of \textsf{hasSize}, scoped by \textsf{xsd:positiveInteger}, is \textsf{Bag}.
\item Range: the range of \textsf{hasSize} is an \textsf{xsd:positiveInteger}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Competency Question}
\label{cqs:Aggregation,}
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\begin{enumerate}[CQ1.]
\item What bag is this item an element of?
\item What is the size of this bag?
\item What resource does this item refer to?
\item What are the items contained in this bag?
\end{enumerate}
