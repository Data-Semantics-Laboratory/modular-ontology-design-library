	Abstract = {{A taxonomy of part-whole or meronymic relations is developed to explain the ordinary English-speaker's use of the term "part of" and its cognates. The resulting classification yields six types of meronymic relations: 1. component-integral object (pedal-bike), 2. member-collection (ship-fleet), 3. portion-mass (slice-pie), 4. stuff-object (steel-car), 5. feature-activity (paying-shopping), and 6. place-area (Everglades-Florida). Meronymic relations ore further distinguished from other inclusion relations, such as spatial inclusion, and class inclusion, and from several other semantic relations: attribution, attachment, and ownership. This taxonomy is then used to explain cases of apparent intransitivity in merological syllogisms, and standard form syllogisms whose premises express different inclusion relations. The data suggest that intransitivities arise due to equivocations between different types of semantic relations. These results are then explained by means of the relation element theory which accounts for the character and behavior of semantic relations in terms of more primitive relational elements. The inferential phenomena observed are then explained by means of a single principle of element matching.}},

@article{citeulike:3893520,
	Abstract = {{BACKGROUND: Over a period of 40 years, SNOMED has developed from a pathology-specific nomenclature (SNOP) into a logic-based health care terminology. In spite of its long existence and continuous evolvement, it is yet unknown to what extent SNOMED is used in clinical practice, and what benefits were achieved. The aim of this paper is to investigate this by providing an overview of published studies in which a version of SNOMED was studied or applied. METHODS: This paper analyzes the use of SNOMED over time, as reflected in scientific publications, by means of Medline literature search in PubMed. The search included papers from 1966 until June 2006. For each selected paper the following characteristics were classified: version, medical domain, coding moment (during or after the care process), usage, and type of evaluation (e.g., does SNOMED work, does SNOMED help). RESULTS: 250 papers were included in this research. The number of annual publications has increased, as has the number of domains in which SNOMED is being used. Theoretical studies mainly concern comparison of SNOMED to other terminological systems and SNOMED as an illustration of a terminological systems' theory. Few studies are available on the usage of SNOMED in clinical practice, largely involving coding information and retrieval/aggregation based on SNOMED codes. CONCLUSION: The clinical application of SNOMED is broadening beyond pathology. The majority of studies concern proving the value of SNOMED in theory. Fewer studies are available on the usage of SNOMED in clinical practice. Literature gives no indication of the use of SNOMED for direct care purposes such as decision support.}},

	Abstract = {{WordNet, an electronic lexical database, is considered to be the most important resource available to researchers in computational linguistics, text analysis, and many related areas. Its design is inspired by current psycholinguistic and computational theories of human lexical memory. English nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs are organized into synonym sets, each representing one underlying lexicalized concept. Different relations link the synonym sets. <P>The purpose of this volume is twofold. First, it discusses the design of WordNet and the theoretical motivations behind it. Second, it provides a survey of representative applications, including word sense identification, information retrieval, selectional preferences of verbs, and lexical chains. <P>Contributors: Reem Al-Halimi, Robert C.

	Abstract = {The Web of Linked Data is characterized by linking structured data from different sources using equivalence statements, such as owl:sameAs, as well as other types of linked properties. The ontologies behind these sources, however, remain unlinked. This paper describes an extensional approach to generate alignments between these ontologies. Specifically our algorithm produces equivalence and subsumption relationships between classes from ontologies of different Linked Data sources by exploring the space of hypotheses supported by the existing equivalence statements. We are also able to generate a complementary hierarchy of derived classes within an existing ontology or generate new classes for a second source where the ontology is not as refined as the first. We demonstrate empirically our approach using Linked Data sources from the geospatial, genetics, and zoology domains. Our algorithm discovered about 800 equivalences and 29,000 subset relationships in the alignment of five source pairs from these domains. Thus, we are able to model one Linked Data source in terms of another by aligning their ontologies and understand the semantic relationships between the two sources.},
